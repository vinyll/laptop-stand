# Foldable laptop stand

This is a 3D printable laptop stand made for small laptops to keep the screen at the level of the eyes.

[Editable file is available on Tinker](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dxNNuTGONvw/editv2).

It is compatible with small home 3D printers (<20cm/8inch).

Works yet to be improved!
The left side and right are currently different. TODO: use the right side for the left side.
